====================
00:00 - 01:00  Example
    This is an example of the worklog format

01:00 - __:__  Start Task
    When you run `start-task` it will end the last task (see below) and start a
    new task at the current time and ending at an unspecified time: __:__

03:00 - 04:14  End Task
    When you run `end-task` it will replace the last task's "__:__" with the
    current time.
